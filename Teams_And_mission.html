            <h2>Wiring</h2>
            <p>Our wiring team has been heavily invested in researching and developing the robot’s electronics. They have spent time developing the robot’s many functional systems while taking power limits and safety into consideration. The wiring team plans on utilizing a Raspberry Pi and Arduino system to control the motors, tools, cameras, and control system. Members of this group include Brendan Booth, Dipayan Dhar, and Chizurum Azu-Emuchay.</p>

            <h2>3D-Printing</h2>
            <p>3D Printing - one of the latest and well-renowned forms of development and innovation. Viking Industries is proud to have our very own 3D Printing department, which is  responsible for designing and printing the components of our robot.This year we used a Eryone ER-20 generously donated to us by PolyUnity. We used the printer to create joints to connect aluminum pieces we used, which allowed us to achieve high levels of precision on the joint angles. We also used it to print parts of our tool because of how it can easily print high complexity and precise parts that would be extremely difficult to fabricate by hand. Our 3-D printing team consisted of Brendan Booth, Samiran Chauhan, Orpa Hawlader, and Emma Penney.

            <h2>Coding</h2>
            <p>The coding team has been working on programming the Arduino and Raspberry Pi microcontrollers for the robot. The robot is programmed using Python and the Arduino framework, which is based on C++ and a bit of C. This team has created the control system for the robot, managing motor speeds, servo movement, and gathering data from sensors. We have designed the control system in order for the pilot to effectively maneuver the robot and utilize its functions. Members of the coding team included Dipayan Dhar, Abner Zhang, Shalom Alemu, and Riley Skanes.</p>
